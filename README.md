## sorting_wasm

My first try using WASM+Rust to create a library for one of my small projects.

This library currently implements:
* Bubble sort.
* Insertion sort.
* Selection sort.
* Quick sort.
* Merge sort.
* Heap sort.

Each one of them return as a result all the steps taken to achieve the sorting, coupled with the two items that were being swapped at each point.
